        <h4><i>by Herman de Coninck</i></h4>
        <p>
          We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br />
          And in spring too I feel no different.<br />
          We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves through much
          dark-red loss, <i>appellation controlée</i>,<br /><br />
          that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br />
          We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br />
          Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees sounding like an oboe,
          tramp among instruments.<br /><br />
          33, and in the midst of the dark wood of life.<br />
          And with a sense of nowhere belonging, at home in the woods and
          desolate at home.<br /><br />
          Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br />
          The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br />
          The here is nowhere, and the now is never.
        </p>
