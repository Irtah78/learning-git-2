        <h1>Taarlo</h1>
        <h4>by Herman de Coninck</h4>
        <a
          >We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day. And in spring too I
          feel no different. We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves
          through much dark-red loss, appellation controlée,<br><br> that deepens in the
          cellar of the years. We walk through the beiger-turning woods of
          Drente. Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees sounding like
          an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br><br> 33, and in the midst of the dark
          wood of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging, at home in the
          woods and desolate at home.<br><br> Will we one day, maybe, ever? The summer
          is past, the hay-making is over. The here is nowhere, and the now is
          never.
